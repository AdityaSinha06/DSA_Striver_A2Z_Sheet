Say, there're n items, each having some value and weight.

we got a bag/knapsack that is having a limit to which it can hold weight of the items inside.
so, we need to put items in the knapsack such that we get a maximum value. (we can break the items too.)

since, we need to get a maximum value given that there's a constraint on the weight of objects we can take.
as we want highest toal value, we just need to equalise their weights so that we can compare values on a common ground.
we need to pick elements whose value is most considering per unit wt of it.

So, we'll need to pick the objects first whose val/wt is maximum.

:> app:
1. sort the items on the basisi of their value per unit weight. in desc order.
2. start picking items until the remaining capacity in the knapsack becomes 0. Ya, it's possible coz' we're allowed to break the items too.
